Methods:  

public static boolean crashCheck(int [] b1, int [] b2) - Returns true if there is a crash

arguments are int arrays with xCenter, yCenter,  width (x direction)and length (y direction) -Same as in Bike class

 public static int winner(int [] b1, int [] b2)

Method comparing and returning winner. Arguments are int arrays with xCenter, yCenter,  width (x direction)and length (y direction) 

return 1 or 2  if first or second  Bike is leading returns 3 if it is a tie.

(Give code for the classes  and the method(s) asked in the question ONLY. No additional code should be added. Any additional code main, System.out,  etc. will result in zero marks. Access specifiers have to be as specified)
