Give code for a class  Vec3D. It represents a 3 dimensional vector.
It has a constructor taking two parameters of int [] type. These are the two end points with 3 int values for x, y and z dimension.
It overrides the toString() method of the Object class to return a String (no spaces)
length in x+"i"+length in y+"j"+length in z+"k"+magnitude 
lengths are positive values and magnitude is rounded to nearest long. 
Javadoc is given.
Example:
p1: [1, 2, 3]  //1st point
p2: [4, 5, 1]  //2nd point
vectorA : positive {(4-1)i+(5-2)j+(1-3)k} = 3i+3j+2k  
magnitude of vector A:Rounded{ (9+9+4)Â½} = 5
public String toString() should return (no space in between characters)
3i+3j+2k5
