Give code for the classes BankAccount (public) ,  SavingsAccount (package) and CurrentAccount (package) representing bank accounts. The SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount are two child classes of BankAccount. All of them have a constructor taking one parameter of double type that sets the balance amount in the bank account. Methods: 
BankAccount:   protected boolean checkBalance() that checks and returns if the balance is greater than or equal 1000 Rs. If it isnâ€™t it will call the method protected void deduct() that deducts 10% of the current balance as penalty.  public double getBalance() that returns the balance (Rounded to 2 decimal places).
 SavingsAccount follows the same deduction policy. 
CurrentAccount deducts an additional 5% from the already deducted balance if the balance before deductions was less than 1000.
Javadoc is given.
Example:
b1: SavingsAccount (balance = 999)
b2: CurrentAccount (balance = 999)

On calling checkBalance() on both methods.
b1.balance = 899.10
b2.balance = 854.15

Explanation:
b1: 999*0.9 = 899.10
b2: 999*0.9 = 899.1 -> 899.1*0.95 = 854.15
